<h1>1. The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h1>

<p id="para1">
    There once was a boy who grew bored while watching over the village sheep. He wanted to make things more exciting.
     So, he yelled out that he saw a wolf chasing the sheep. All the villagers came running 
     to drive the wolf away. However, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused, but the villagers were not. 
     They told him not to do it again. Shortly after, he repeated this antic. The villagers came running again, 

     
     only to find that he was lying. Later that day, the boy really sees a wolf sneaking amongst the flock.
      He jumped up and called out for help. But no one came this time because they thought he was still joking around. 
      At sunset, the villagers looked for the boy. He had not returned with their sheep. They found him crying. 
      He told them that there really was a wolf, and the entire flock was gone. An old man came to comfort him and told him that nobody would 
      believe a liar even when they are being honest.

  Moral: Lying breaks trust.

 The Greek king Midas did a good deed for a Satyr. This prompted Dionysus, the god of wine, 
 to grant him a wish. Midas asked for everything he touched to turn to gold. Dionysus’ warned him not to do so, 
 but Midas could not be swayed. Midas excitedly started touching everything and turning them into gold. Soon, 
 he became hungry. But he couldn’t eat anything because even his food turned to gold. His beloved daughter saw him 
 in distress and ran to hug him. However, she, too, turned to gold. He realised then the golden touch was not a blessing.

 Moral: Greed leads one to downfall.<br>
 <br>

 A hungry fox once looked everywhere for food. He couldn’t find anything until he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall.
 He saw big, purple, juicy grapes. He jumped as high as possible to reach the grapes. No matter how many times 
 he tried, he failed. Finally, he gave up and went home, thinking to himself that the grapes must have been sour anyway.

 Moral: Nothing comes easy, do not hate what you can’t have.

 In the desert existed a rose and a cactus. The beautiful rose would take every opportunity to insult the cactus.
 The other plants tried to defend the cactus, but the rose was too obsessed with its own looks. There was no water 
 during a particularly hot summer. The rose started to wither away. <br>
But the cactus had become a source of water for sparrows.
  The rose asked the cactus for water, and the nice cactus readily agreed.
  <br>


 Moral: Never judge someone according to how they look.

 Molly, the milkmaid’s job was to milk the cows and sell the milk at the market. She started thinking about the things 
 she would spend her money on. While walking to the market, she spotted a chicken and thought that she could earn more 
 money by buying a chicken and selling its eggs. <br>
 She started to think how jealous she could make the other milkmaid with 
 all the things she could buy from the milk and egg money. She started to skip in excitement, and soon the milk spilled over. 
 She went home with empty pails and no money. <br>
 Her mother then reminds her that she shouldn’t count her chicken until they hatch.

<Center><h1>The Stars in the Sky</h1></Center>
<br>
<p id="para3">
  Once on a time and twice on a time, and all times together as ever I heard tell of, there was a tiny lassie who would weep all day to have the stars in the sky to play with; she wouldn’t have this, and she wouldn’t have that, but it was always the stars she would have. So one fine day off she went to find them. And she walked and she walked and she walked, till by-and-by she came to a mill-dam.

“Goode’en to ye,” says she, “I’m seeking the stars in the sky to play with. Have you seen any?”

“Oh, yes, my bonnie lassie,” said the mill-dam. “They shine in my own face o’ nights till I can’t sleep for them. Jump in and perhaps you’ll find one.”

So she jumped in, and swam about and swam about and swam about, but ne’er a one could she see. So she went on till she came to a brooklet.

“Goode’en to ye, Brooklet, Brooklet,” says she; “I’m seeking the stars in the sky to play with. Have you seen any?”

“Yes, indeed, my bonny lassie,” said the Brooklet. “They glint on my banks at night. Paddle about, and maybe you’ll find one.”<br>

So she paddled and she paddled and she paddled, but ne’er a one did she find. So on she went till she came to the Good Folk.

“Goode’en to ye, Good Folk,” says she; “I’m looking for the stars in the sky to play with. Have ye seen e’er a one?”

“Why, yes, my bonny lassie,” said the Good Folk. “They shine on the grass here o’ night. Dance with us, and maybe you’ll find one.”

And she danced and she danced and she danced, but ne’er a one did she see. So down she sate; I suppose she wept.

“Oh dearie me, oh dearie me,” says she, “I’ve swam and I’ve paddled and I’ve danced, and if ye’ll not help me I shall never find the stars in the sky to play with.”

But the Good Folk whispered together, and one of them came up to her and took her by the hand and said, “If you won’t go home to your mother, go forward, go forward; mind you take the right road. Ask Four Feet to carry you to No Feet at all, and tell No Feet at all to carry you to the stairs without steps, and if you can climb that—”

“If you’ll not be, then you’ll be elsewhere,” said the Good Folk, and set to dancing again.

So on she went again with a light heart, and by-and-by she came to a saddled horse, tied to a tree.<br>

“Goode’en to ye, Beast,” said she; “I’m seeking the stars in the sky to play with. Will you give me a lift, for all my bones are an-aching.”

“Nay,” said the horse, “I know nought of the stars in the sky, and I’m here to do the bidding of the Good Folk, and not my own will.”

“Well,” said she, “it’s from the Good Folk I come, and they bade me tell Four Feet to carry me to No Feet at all.”

“That’s another story,” said he; “jump up and ride with me.”<br>

So they rode and they rode and they rode, till they got out of the forest and found themselves at the edge of the sea. And on the water in front of them was a wide glistening path running straight out towards a beautiful thing that rose out of the water and went up into the sky, and was all the colours in the world, blue and red and green, and wonderful to look at.

“Now get you down,” said the horse; “I’ve brought ye to the end of the land, and that’s as much as Four Feet can do. I must away home to my own folk.”

“But,” said the lassie, “where’s No Feet at all, and where’s the stair without steps?”<br>

“I know not,” said the horse, “it’s none of my business neither. So goode’en to ye, my bonny lassie;” and off he went.

So the lassie stood still and looked <br>at the water, till a strange kind of fish came swimming up to her feet.

“Goode’en to ye, big Fish,” says she, “I’m looking for the stars in the sky, and for the stairs that climb up to them. Will ye show me the way?”

“Nay,” said the Fish, “I can’t unless you bring me word from the Good Folk.”<br>

“Yes, indeed,” said she. “They said Four Feet would bring me to No Feet at all, and No Feet at all would carry me to the stairs without steps.”<br>

“Get on my back and hold fast.”
“Ah, well,” said the Fish; “that’s all right then. <br>Get on my back and hold fast.”<br>

And off he went—Kerplash!—into the water, along the silver path, towards the bright arch. And the nearer they came the brighter the sheen of it, till she had to shade her eyes from the light of it.

And as they came to the foot of it, she saw it was a broad bright road,<br> sloping up and away into the sky, and at the far, far end of it she could see wee shining things dancing about.

“Now,” said the Fish, “here you are, and yon’s the stair; climb up, if you can, but hold on fast.<br> I’ll 

So she clomb and<br> she clomb and she clomb, but ne’er a step higher did she get: the light was before her and around her,<br> and the water behind her, and the more she struggled the more she was forced down into the dark and the cold, and the more she clomb the deeper she fell.

But she clomb and she clomb, till she got dizzy in the light and <br>shivered with the cold, and dazed with the fear; but still she clomb, till at last, quite dazed and silly-like, she let clean go, and sank down—down—down.

And bang she came on to the hard boards, <br>and found herself sitting, weeping and wailing, by the bedside at home all alone.


warrant you find the stair easier at home than by such a way; ‘t was ne’er meant for lassies’ feet to travel;” and off he splashed through the water.
